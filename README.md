ToneCrafter is a project developped by students at [ENSEA](https://www.ensea.fr/).  
Our goal is to develop an algorithm capable of analyzing any audio file containing guitar sounds and retrieve its parameters. ToneCrafter will then generate a numeric filter that will modulate your guitar sound and make it sound like the recording you fed it. Exciting isn't it ?  
We are also working on a hardware implementation using a STM32 ÂµC that will allow musicians to use ToneCrafter on stage and tune the different parameters.

## Our work so far
### Software :
We started out trying to use Magenta's [DDSP](https://www.github.com/magenta/ddsp), but this was a bit too ambitious for AI newbies like us, so we tried implementing our own algorithms.  
This sparked three different approaches to our problem:  
  * A CNN based approach where we tried to teach a neural network to recreate a distortion.
  * A "bare coding" approach using math and clever algorithms to recreate a distortion from an audio file
  * A VAE based approach trying to recreate the mechanisms behind Magenta's DDSP

### Hardware :
We started working on different PCB designs using [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) and working on a STM32F7 discovery kit for testing purposes.
## What's next ?
We are trying to figure out how to convert our DDSP output into a numeric filter in order to begin training our model. In the mean time, we will try to implement a simple filter on our STM32F7 and feed it a guitar input to test the viability of our project.

Enjoy!
